This portfolio contains of what i have learned in using PL/SQL. PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language/Structured Query Language. It's a powerful programming language specifically designed for Oracle databases. 

In this journey of using PL/SQL, i want to learned more like the basics of PL/SQL, including how a'm i write blocks of code's, declaring variables, and handle errors. And i know in this lesson i will face difficulty because I'm not yet familiar in using PC, but i know that sir Glenn will help me to familiarize this topic so that It won't be too difficult for me.
