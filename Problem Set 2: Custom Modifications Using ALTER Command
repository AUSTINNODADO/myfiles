1. Add a New Column to Each Table:
   - In Owner add `password` to represent that phone is to the owner.
   - In brand, add `year_buy` it represent when did they buy that phone .

2. Apply a Unique Constraint:
   - We’ll make `password` unique in owner to reflect that each phone has a unique password.


ALTER TABLE Tin_OWNER
ADD password INTEGER UNIQUE;

ALTER TABLE Tin_phone
ADD year_buy INTEGER;
   
   


3. Reflection:
The unique constraint on `password` ensures that each of thier phone  has a unique password, to know that this phone is in the owner . This adds depth to the data, helping the owner to make it easy to track their phones.
